$program -- Not yet implemented.

This file should be used to create a compilation directory
for a particular product.  It runs config/configure.sh to
detect the machine configuration and generates subdirectories
and makefiles.

Usage:

% cd \$topbuilddir
% \$topsrcdir/$program  --prefix=\$installdir  ...options... 


Then you can do any of the following

   make clean		-- remove all object files and executables
   make depend		-- update makefiles with dependency information
   make all



Most of the work is achieved using functions defined in
file config/configure.sh.  There are functions
  - to parse the command line options
  - to detect compiler and compiler options
  - to detect the presence of some features
  - to update the makefiles
