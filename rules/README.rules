This are files that define general rules used in various makes.
To include them, use
	%%%include <FILENAME>
where the greaterthan and less than signs are litteral.

The following rules are defined:
	commands:	This includes MACRO's for most of the common shell
			commands.  This allows you to use things like:
				$(TRUE)
			for
				@%true%@
			The advantage of a macro is the user can override
			the value on the command line.

	depend:		This defines a generic 'make depend' rule.  This
			requires %%%include <commands>
