<BLOCKQUOTE>Context variable.  
Variables of type <TT>BitContext</TT> hold a single byte describing how to encode
or decode message bits with similar statistical properties.  This single
byte simultaneously represents the current estimate of the bit probability
distribution (which is determined by the frequencies of <TT>1</TT>s and <TT>0</TT>s
already coded with this context) and the confidence in this estimate
(which determines how fast the estimate can change.)<P>A coding program typically allocates hundreds of context variables.  Each
coding context is initialized to zero before encoding or decoding.  Value
zero represents equal probabilities for <TT>1</TT>s and <TT>0</TT>s with a minimal
confidence and therefore a maximum adaptation speed.  Each message bit is
encoded using a coding context determined as a function of previously
encoded message bits.  The decoder therefore can examine the previously
decoded message bits and decode the current bit using the same context as
the encoder.  This is critical for proper decoding.  </BLOCKQUOTE>
