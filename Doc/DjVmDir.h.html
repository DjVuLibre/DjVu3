<BLOCKQUOTE>Files <TT>&quot;DjVmDir.h&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;DjVmDir.cpp&quot;</TT> implement class <!1><A HREF="DjVmDir.html">DjVmDir</A> for
representing the directory of a DjVu multipage document.<P><B>Bundled vs. Indirect format</B> --- There are currently two multipage
DjVu formats supported: <EM>bundled</EM> and <EM>indirect</EM>.  In the first
format all component files composing a given document are packaged (or
bundled) into one file, in the second one every page and component is
stored in a separate file and there is one more file, which contains the
list of all others.<P><B>Multipage DjVu format</B> --- Multipage DjVu documents follow the EA
IFF85 format (cf. <!1><A HREF="IFFByteStream.h.html">IFFByteStream.h</A>.)  A document is composed of a
<TT>&quot;FORM:DJVM&quot;</TT> whose first chunk is a <TT>&quot;DIRM&quot;</TT> chunk containing the <EM>
document directory</EM>.  This directory lists all component files composing
the given document, helps to access every component file and identify the
pages of the document.
<UL> 
<LI> In a <EM>bundled</EM> multipage file, the component files 
are stored immediately after the <TT>&quot;DIRM&quot;</TT> chunk,
within the <TT>&quot;FORM:DJVU&quot;</TT> composite chunk.  
<LI> In an <EM>indirect</EM> multipage file, the component files are 
stored in different files whose URLs are composed using information 
stored in the <TT>&quot;DIRM&quot;</TT> chunk.
</UL> 
Most of the component files represent pages of a document.  Some files
however represent data shared by several pages.  The pages refer to these
supporting files by means of an inclusion chunk (<TT>&quot;INCL&quot;</TT> chunks)
identifying the supporting file.<P><B>Document Directory</B> --- Every directory record describes a component
file.  Each component file is identified by a small string named the
identifier (ID).  Each component file also contains a file name and a
title.  The format of the <TT>&quot;DIRM&quot;</TT> chunk is described in section
Format of the DIRM chunk..<P>Theoretically, IDs are used to uniquely identify each component file in
<TT>&quot;INCL&quot;</TT> chunks, names are used to compose the the URLs of the component
files in an indirect multipage DjVu file, and titles are cosmetic names
possibly displayed when viewing a page of a document.  There are however
many problems with this scheme, and we <EM>strongly suggest</EM>, with the
current implementation to always make the file ID, the file name and the
file title identical.<P></BLOCKQUOTE>
