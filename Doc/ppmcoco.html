    </PRE><P><B>Arguments</B><BR>
<DL>
<DT><B>-from &lt;gamma&gt;</B><DD>  
Gamma coefficient of the display for which the image was designed.
The default value 2.2 is assumed when this argument is omitted.
<DT><B>-to &lt;gamma&gt;</B><DD>  
Gamma coefficient of the display on the image will be rendered.
The default value 2.2 is assumed when this argument is omitted.
<DT><B>&lt;ppmin&gt;</B><DD>
Name of the PPM file to read. A single dash (<TT>&quot;-&quot;</TT>) means that the PPM
file is to be read on the standard input.  See 
<!1><A HREF="PNMandRLEfileformats.html">PNM and RLE file formats</A> for more information about PPM files.
<DT><B>&lt;ppmout&gt;</B><DD>
Name of the PPM file into which the color corrected image will be written.
Omitting this argument or providing a single dash (<TT>&quot;-&quot;</TT>) means that the
PPM data will be written to the standard output.

<B>Description</B> ---
File <TT>&quot;ppmcoco.cpp&quot;</TT> illustrates how the DjVu Reference Library performs
color correction on <!1><A HREF="GPixmap.html">GPixmap</A> objects.  Each color image is in theory
designed to be rendered on a particular device.  In order to display this
image on a different device, we need to correct the image in order to
compensate the differences between the color profile of the <EM>design
device</EM> (the device for which the image was designed) and the color
profile of the <EM>rendering device</EM> (the device on which the image will
be displayed.)<P>The current release of the DjVu Reference Library only implements gamma
correction.  Cathodic displays are reasonably well characterized by a
single floating point number called ``gamma''.  Typical gamma values 
are given in the table below:

</TR></TABLE></CENTER><P>Gamma correction is performed by function <!1><A HREF="GPixmap.html#DOC.1.4.20.2.6.3">color_correct</A> in
class <!1><A HREF="GPixmap.html">GPixmap</A>.  The argument of function <TT>color_correct</TT> must be the
ratio between the gamma coefficient of the rendering device and the gamma
coefficient of the design device.  This function works best when both
gamma coefficients are close, partly because the color values have a
limited dynamical range, and partly because we do not exactly perform a
regular gamma correction: regular gamma correction tends to reveal ugly
data compression artifacts in the dark areas of the image.  We suggest
therefore to design images with a intermediate gamma coefficient.  Value
2.2 gives decent results on all computers.  This value is suggested by
several photo editing programs (such as Photoshop), and is
supported by virtually all scanner drivers.<P>Program <TT>ppmcoco</TT> reads a PPM file <TT>ppmin</TT> containing an image designed
for a display whose gamma coefficient is specified with option <TT>-from</TT>.
Color correction is then performed for a display whose gamma coefficient
is specified with option <TT>-to</TT>.  The corrected file is then written into
PPM file <TT>ppmout</TT>.<P></BLOCKQUOTE>
