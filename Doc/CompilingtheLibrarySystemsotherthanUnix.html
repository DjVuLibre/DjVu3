This library compiles without modification under Windows using Visual C++
version 5.0.  It should also compile under MacOS using the MetroWerks
compiler, although some system dependent functions are still missing.  In
both cases however, you have to provide your makefile (or your project, or
your workspace or whatever) using the Unix makefiles as a template.
