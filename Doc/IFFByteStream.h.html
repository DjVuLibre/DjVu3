<BLOCKQUOTE>
Files <TT>&quot;IFFByteStream.h&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;IFFByteStream.cpp&quot;</TT> implement a parser for
files structured according the Electronic Arts ``EA IFF 85 Interchange
File Format''.  IFF files are composed of a sequence of data <EM>chunks</EM>.
Each chunk is identified by a four character <EM>chunk identifier</EM>
describing the type of the data stored in the chunk.  A few special chunk
identifiers, for instance <TT>&quot;FORM&quot;</TT>, are reserved for <EM>composite
chunks</EM> which themselves contain a sequence of data chunks.  This
conventions effectively provides IFF files with a convenient hierarchical
structure.  Composite chunks are further identified by a secondary chunk
identifier.<P>We found convenient to define a <EM>extended chunk identifier</EM>.  In the
case of a regular chunk, the extended chunk identifier is simply the
chunk identifier, as in <TT>&quot;PM44&quot;</TT>. In the case of a composite chunk, the
extended chunk identifier is composed by concatenating the main chunk
identifier, a colon, and the secondary chunk identifier, as in
<TT>&quot;FORM:DJVU&quot;</TT>.<P>Class <!1><A HREF="IFFByteStream.html">IFFByteStream</A> provides a way to read or write IFF structured
files.  Member functions provide an easy mean to position the underlying
<!1><A HREF="ByteStream.html">ByteStream</A> at the beginning of each chunk and to read or write the
data until reaching the end of the chunk.  The utility program
<!1><A HREF="djvuinfo.2.html">djvuinfo</A> demonstrates how to use class <TT>IFFByteStream</TT>.<P><B>IFF Files and ZP-Coder</B> ---
Class <TT>IFFByteStream</TT> repositions the underlying ByteStream whenever a new
chunk is accessed.  It is possible to code chunk data with the ZP-Coder
without worrying about the final file position. See class <!1><A HREF="ZPCodec.html">ZPCodec</A>
for more details.<P><B>DjVu IFF Files</B> --- We had initially planned to exactly follow the
IFF specifications.  Then we realized that certain versions of MSIE
recognize any IFF file as a Microsoft AIFF sound file and pop a message
box "Cannot play that sound".  It appears that the structure of AIFF files
is entirely modeled after the IFF standard, with small variations
regarding the endianness of numbers and the padding rules.  We eliminate
this problem by casting the octet protection spell.  Our IFF files always
start with the four octets <TT>0x41,0x54,0x26,0x54</TT> followed by the fully
conformant IFF byte stream.  Class <TT>IFFByteStream</TT> silently skips these
four octets when it encounters them.<P><B>References</B> --- EA IFF 85 Interchange File Format specification:<BR>
