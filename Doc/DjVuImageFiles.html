<B>Photo DjVu Image</B> --- Photo DjVu Image files are best used for
encoding photographic images in colors or in shades of gray.  The data
compression model relies on the IW44 wavelet representation.  This format
is designed such that the IW44 decoder is able to quickly perform
progressive rendering of any image segment using only a small amount of
memory.  Photo DjVu files are composed of a single <TT>&quot;FORM:DJVU&quot;</TT> composite
chunk.  This composite chunk always begins with one <TT>&quot;INFO&quot;</TT> chunk
describing the image size and resolution (see <!1><A HREF="DjVuInfo.h.html">DjVuInfo.h</A>).  One or
more additional <TT>&quot;BG44&quot;</TT> chunks contains the image data encoded with the
IW44 representation (see <!1><A HREF="IWImage.h.html">IWImage.h</A>).  The image size specified in
the <TT>&quot;INFO&quot;</TT> chunk and the image size specified in the IW44 data must be
equal.<P><B>Bilevel DjVu Image</B> --- Bilevel DjVu Image files are used to compress
black and white images representing text and simple drawings.   The
JB2 data compression model uses the soft pattern matching technique, which
essentially consists of encoding each character by describing how it
differs from a well chosen already encoded character.  Bilevel DjVu Files
are composed of a single <TT>&quot;FORM:DJVU&quot;</TT> composite chunk.  This composite
chunk always begins with one <TT>&quot;INFO&quot;</TT> chunk describing the image size and
resolution (see <!1><A HREF="DjVuInfo.h.html">DjVuInfo.h</A>).  An additional <TT>&quot;Sjbz&quot;</TT> chunk contains
the bilevel data encoded with the JB2 representation (see
<!1><A HREF="JB2Image.h.html">JB2Image.h</A>).  The image size specified in the <TT>&quot;INFO&quot;</TT> chunk and the
image size specified in the JB2 data must be equal.<P><B>Compound DjVu Image</B> --- Compound DjVu Files are an extremely
efficient way to compress high resolution Compound document images
containing both pictures and text, such as a page of a magazine.  Compound
DjVu Files represent the document images using two layers.  The <EM>
background layer</EM> is used for encoding the pictures and the paper texture.
The <EM>foreground layer</EM> is used for encoding the text and the drawings.
Compound DjVu Files are composed of a single <TT>&quot;FORM:DJVU&quot;</TT> composite
chunk.  This composite chunk always begins with one <TT>&quot;INFO&quot;</TT> chunk
describing the size and the resolution of the image (see <!1><A HREF="DjVuInfo.html">DjVuInfo</A>).
Additional chunks hold the components of either the foreground or the
background layers.<P>The main component of the foreground layer is a bilevel image named the
<EM>foreground mask</EM>. The pixel size of the foreground mask is equal to
the size of the DjVu image.  It contains a black-on-white representation
of the text and the drawings.  This image is encoded by a <TT>&quot;Sjbz&quot;</TT> chunk
using the JB2 representation.  There may also be a companion chunk
<TT>&quot;Djbz&quot;</TT> containing a <EM>shape dictionary</EM> that defines bilevel shapes
referenced by the <TT>&quot;Sjbz&quot;</TT> chunk.<P>The <EM>foreground colors</EM> can be encoded according to two models:
<UL>
<LI> 
The foreground colors may be encoded using a small color image, the <EM>
foreground color image</EM>, encoded as a single <TT>&quot;FG44&quot;</TT> chunk using the
IW44 representation (see <!1><A HREF="IWImage.h.html">IWImage.h</A>).  Such compound DjVu images
are rendered by painting the foreground color image on top of the
background color image using the foreground mask as a stencil.  The
pixel size of the foreground color image is computed by rounding up the
quotient of the mask size by an integer sub-sampling factor ranging from
1 to 12.  Most Compound DjVu Images use a foreground color sub-sampling
factor of 12.  Smaller sub-sampling factors produce very slightly better
images.
<LI> 
The foreground colors may be encoded by specifying one solid color per
object described by the JB2 encoded mask. These <EM>JB2 colors</EM> are
color-quantized and stored in a single <TT>&quot;FGbz&quot;</TT> chunk (see.
DjVuPalette.h).  Such compound DjVu images are rendered by
painting each foreground object on top of the background color image
using the solid color specified by the <TT>&quot;FGbz&quot;</TT> chunk.
</UL><P>The background layer is a color image, the background color image
ncoded by an arbitrary number of <TT>&quot;BG44&quot;</TT> chunks containing successive
IW44 refinements (see <!1><A HREF="IWImage.h.html">IWImage.h</A>).  The size of this image is
computed by rounding up the quotient of the mask size by an integer
sub-sampling factor ranging from 1 to 12.  Most Compound DjVu Images use a
background sub-sampling factor equal to 3.  Smaller sub-sampling factors
are adequate for images with a very rich paper texture.  Larger
sub-sampling factors are adequate for images containing no pictures.<P>There are no ordering or interleaving constraints on these chunks except
that (a) the <TT>&quot;INFO&quot;</TT> chunk must appear first, and (b) the successive
<TT>&quot;BG44&quot;</TT> refinements must appear with their natural order.  The chunk
order simply affects the progressive rendering of DjVu images on a web
browser.  <P><B>Alternative encodings</B> --- Besides the JB2 and IW44 encoding schemes,
the DjVu format supports alternative encoding methods for its components.  
<UL>
<LI>
The foreground mask may be represented by a single <TT>&quot;Smmr&quot;</TT> chunk
instead of <TT>&quot;Sjbz&quot;</TT>.  The <TT>&quot;Smmr&quot;</TT> chunk contains a bilevel image
encoded with the Fax-G4/MMR method.  Although the resulting files
are typically six times larger, this capability can be useful when
DjVu is used as a front-end for fax machines and scanners with 
embedded Fax-G4/MMR capabilities. 
<LI>
The background color image may be represented by a single <TT>&quot;BGjp&quot;</TT>
chunk instead of several <TT>&quot;BG44&quot;</TT> chunks.  The <TT>&quot;BGjp&quot;</TT> chunk contains
a JPEG encoded color image.  The resulting files are significantly
larger and lack the progressivity of the usual DjVu files.  
This is useful because some scanners have embedded JPEG capabilities.
<LI>
The foreground color image may be represented by a single <TT>&quot;FGjp&quot;</TT>
chunk instead of a single <TT>&quot;FG44&quot;</TT> chunk.  This is useful because 
some scanners have embedded JPEG capabilities.
</UL>
In addition, the chunk names <TT>&quot;BG2k&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;FG2k&quot;</TT> have been reserved for
encoding the background color image and the foreground color image using
the forthcoming JPEG-2000 standard.  This capability is not implemented at
the moment.  The JPEG-2000 standard may even become the preferred encoding
method for color images in DjVu.  </BLOCKQUOTE>
