<BLOCKQUOTE>
The DjVu3 system supports two models for multi-page documents:
<EM>bundled</EM> multi-page documents and <EM>indirect</EM> multi-page documents.
The multi-page API allows you to assemble already compressed pages and to
create multipage DjVu documents using either model.<P><B>Bundled multi-page documents</B> --- A <EM>bundled</EM> multi-page DjVu
document uses a single file to represent the entire document.  This single
file contains all the pages as well as ancillary information (e.g. the
page directory, data shared by several pages, thumbnails, etc.).  Using a
single file format is very convenient for storing documents or for sending
email attachments.<P>A bundled multi-page document is composed of a single <TT>&quot;FORM:DJVM&quot;</TT>
composite chunk.  This composite chunk always begins with a <TT>&quot;DIRM&quot;</TT> chunk
containing the document directory (see. <!1><A HREF="DjVmDir.h.html">DjVmDir.h</A>) which represents
the list of the <EM>component files</EM> that compose the document.  The
component files themselves are then encoded as IFF85 composite chunks
following the <TT>&quot;DIRM&quot;</TT> chunk.
<UL>
<LI>  
Component files may be any valid DjVu image (see <!1><A HREF="DjVuImageFiles.html">DjVu Image Files</A>)
or IW44 image (see <!1><A HREF="IW44ImageFiles.html">IW44 Image Files</A>.)  These component files 
always represent a page of a document.  The corresponding IFF85 chunk ids are 
<TT>&quot;FORM:DJVU&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;FORM:PM44&quot;</TT>, or <TT>&quot;FORM:BM44&quot;</TT>.
<LI> 
Component files may contain shared information indirectly referenced by
some document pages.  These <EM>shared component files</EM> are always composed
of a single <TT>&quot;FORM:DJVI&quot;</TT> chunk containing an arbitrary collection of
chunks. 
<LI>
Thumbnail files contain optional thumbnail images for a few consecutive
pages of the document.  Thumbnail files consist of a single
<TT>&quot;FORM:THUM&quot;</TT> composite chunk containing several <TT>&quot;TH44&quot;</TT> chunks
containing IW44 encoded thumbnail images (see <!1><A HREF="IWImage.h.html">IWImage.h</A>).  These
thumbnails always pertain the first few page files following the
thumbnail file in the document directory.
</UL><P><B>Including shared information</B> --- Any DjVu image file contained in a
multipage file may contain an <TT>&quot;INCL&quot;</TT> chunk containing the ID of a shared
component file.  The decoder should then process the chunks contained in
the shared component file as if they were contained by the DjVu image
file.  The shared component file may potentially containing any
information otherwise allowed in a DjVu image file (except for the
<TT>&quot;INFO&quot;</TT> chunk of course). There are many benefits associated with storing
such shared information in separate files.  A well designed browser may
keep pre-decoded copies of these files in a cache.  This procedure would
reduce the size of the data transferred over the Internet and also
increase the display speed.  The multipage DjVu compressor, for instance,
identifies similar object shapes occuring in several pages.  These shapes
are encoded in a shape dictionary (chunk <TT>&quot;Djbz&quot;</TT>) placed in a shared
component file.  All relevant pages include this shared component file.
Although they appear in several pages, these shared shapes are encoded
only once in the document.<P><B>Browsing a multi-page document</B> --- You can view the pages using the
DjVu plugin and a web browser.  When you type the URL of a multi-page
document, the browser starts downloading the whole file, but displays the
first page as soon as it is available.  You can immediately navigate to
other pages using the DjVu toolbar.  Suppose however that the document is
stored on a remote web server.  You can easily access the first page and
see that this is not the document you wanted.  Although you will never
display the other pages the browser is transferring data for these pages
and is wasting the bandwith of your server (and the bandwith of the
Internet too).  You could also see the summary of the document on the
first page and jump to page 100.  But page 100 cannot be displayed until
data for pages 1 to 99 has been received.  You may have to wait for the
transmission of unnecessary page data.  This second problem (the
unnecessary wait) can be solved using the ``byte serving'' options of the
HTTP/1.1 protocol.  This option has to be supported by the web server, the
proxies, the caches and the browser.  We are coming there but not quite
yet.  Byte serving however does not solve the first problem (the waste of
bandwith).<P><B>Indirect multi-page documents</B> --- DjVu solves both problem using a
special multi-page format named the <EM>indirect</EM> model.  An indirect
multi-page DjVu document is composed of several files.  The main file is
named the <EM>index file</EM>.  You can browse a document using the URL of
the index file, just like you do with a bundled multi-page document.  The
index file however is very small.  It simply contains the document
directory and the URLs of secondary files containing the page data.  When
you browse an indirect multi-page document, the browser only accesses data
for the pages you are viewing.  This can be done at a reasonable speed
because the browser maintains a cache of pages and sometimes pre-fetches a
few pages ahead of the current page.  This model uses the web serving
bandwith much more effectively.  It also eliminates unnecessary delays
when jumping ahead to pages located anywhere in a long document.<P><B>Obsolete Formats</B> --- The library also supports two other multipage
formats which are now obsolete.  These formats are technologically
inferior and should no longer be used. </BLOCKQUOTE>
