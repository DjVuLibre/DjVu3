Files <TT>&quot;JB2Image.h&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;JB2Image.cpp&quot;</TT> address the compression of
bilevel images using the JB2 soft pattern matching scheme.  These files
provide the complete decoder and the decoder back-end.  The JB2 scheme is
optimized for images containing a large number of self-similar small
components such as characters.  Typical text images can be compressed into
files 3 to 5 times smaller than with G4/MMR and 2 to 4 times smaller than
with JBIG1.<P><B>JB2 and JBIG2</B> --- JB2 has strong similarities with the forthcoming
JBIG2 standard developed by the "ISO/IEC JTC1 SC29 Working Group 1" which
is responsible for both the JPEG and JBIG standards.  This is hardly
surprising since JB2 was our own proposal for the JBIG2 standard
and remained the only proposal for years.  The full JBIG2 standard however
is significantly more complex and slighlty less efficient than JB2 because
it addresses a broader range of applications.  Full JBIG2 compliance may
be implemented in the future.<P><B>JB2 Images</B> --- Class <!1><A HREF="JB2Image.html">JB2Image</A> is the central data structure
implemented here.  A <TT>JB2Image</TT> is composed of an array of shapes
and an array of blits.  Each shape contains a small bitmap representing an
elementary blob of ink, such as a character or a segment of line art.
Each blit instructs the decoder to render a particular shape at a
specified position in the image.  Some compression is already achieved
because several blits can refer to the same shape.  A shape can also
contain a pointer to a parent shape.  Additional compression is achieved
when both shapes are similar because each shape is encoded using the
parent shape as a model.  A <TT>&quot;O&quot;</TT> shape for instance could be a parent for
both a <TT>&quot;C&quot;</TT> shape and a <TT>&quot;Q&quot;</TT> shape.<P><B>JB2 Dictionary</B> --- Class <!1><A HREF="JB2Dict.html">JB2Dict</A> is a peculiar kind of
JB2Image which only contains an array of shapes.  These shapes can be
referenced from another JB2Dict/JB2Image.  This is arranged by setting the
``inherited dictionary'' of a JB2Dict/JB2Image using function
<!1><A HREF="JB2Dict.html#DOC.1.4.24.4.5">set_inherited_dict</A>. Several JB2Images can use shapes from a
same JB2Dict encoded separately.  This is how several pages of a same
document can share information.<P><B>Decoding JB2 data</B> --- The first step for decoding JB2 data consists of 
creating an empty <TT>JB2Image</TT> object.  Function <!1><A HREF="JB2Image.html#DOC.1.4.24.5.14">decode</A> then
reads the data and populates the <TT>JB2Image</TT> with the shapes and the blits.
Function <!1><A HREF="JB2Image.html#DOC.1.4.24.5.7">get_bitmap</A> finally produces an anti-aliased image.<P><B>Encoding JB2 data</B> --- The first step for decoding JB2 data also
consists of creating an empty <TT>JB2Image</TT> object.  You must then use
functions <!1><A HREF="JB2Dict.html#DOC.1.4.24.4.9">add_shape</A> and <!1><A HREF="JB2Image.html#DOC.1.4.24.5.11">add_blit</A> to
populate the <TT>JB2Image</TT> object.  Function <!1><A HREF="JB2Image.html#DOC.1.4.24.5.13">encode</A> finally
produces the JB2 data.  Function
and the necessary shapes.  The compression ratio depends on several
factors:
<UL>
<LI> Blits should reuse shapes as often as possible.
<LI> Blits should be sorted in reading order because this facilitates
the prediction of the blit coordinates.
<LI> Shapes should be sorted according to the order of first appearance
in the sequence of blits because this facilitates the prediction of the
shape indices.
<LI> Shapes should be compared to all previous shapes in the shape array.
The shape parent pointer should be set to a suitable parent shape if
such a parent shape exists.  The parent shape should have almost the
same size and the same pixels.
</UL>
All this is quite easy to achieve in the case of an electronically
produced document such as a DVI file or a PS file: we know what the
characters are and where they are located.  If you only have a scanned
image however you must first locate the characters (connected component
analysis) and cut the remaining pieces of ink into smaller blobs.
Ordering the blits and matching the shapes is then an essentially
heuristic process.  Although the quality of the heuristics substantially
effects the file size, misordering blits or mismatching shapes never
effects the quality of the image.  The last refinement consists in
smoothing the shapes in order to reduce the noise and maximize the
similarities between shapes.<P><B>JB2 extensions</B> --- Two extensions of the JB2
encoding format have been introduced with DjVu files version 21. The first
extension addresses the shared shape dictionaries. The second extension
bounds the number of probability contexts used for coding numbers.
Both extensions maintain backward compatibility with JB2 as 
described in the ICFDD proposal. A more complete discussion
can be found in section <!1><A HREF="JB2extensionsforversion21..html">JB2 extensions for version 21.</A>.<P><B>References</B>
