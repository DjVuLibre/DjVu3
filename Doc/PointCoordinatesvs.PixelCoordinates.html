The DjVu technology relies on the accurate superposition of images at
different resolutions.  Such an accuracy cannot be reached with the usual
assumption that pixels are small enough to be considered infinitesimally
small.  We must distinguish very precisely ``points'' and ``pixels''.
This distinction is essential for performing scaling operations.<P>The pixels of an image are identified by ``pixel coordinates''.  The
bottom-left corner pixel has coordinates <TT>(0,0)</TT> and the top-right corner
pixel has coordinates <TT>(w-1,h-1)</TT> where <TT>w</TT> and <TT>h</TT> are the image size.
Pixel coordinates are necessarily integers since pixels never overlap.<P>An infinitesimally small point is identified by its ``point coordinates''.
There may be fractional point coordinates, although this library does not
make use of them.  Points with integer coordinates are located <EM>on the
corners of each pixel</EM>.  They are not located on the pixel centers.  The
center of the pixel with pixel coordinates <TT>(i,j)</TT> is located at point
coordinates <TT>(i+1/2,j+1/2)</TT>.  In other words, the pixel <TT>(i,j)</TT> extends
from point <TT>(i,j)</TT> to point <TT>(i+1,j+1)</TT>.<P>Therefore, the point located on the bottom left corner of an image has
coordinates <TT>(0,0)</TT>.  This point is in fact the bottom left corner of the
bottom left pixel of the image.  The point located on the top right corner
of an image has coordinates <TT>(w,h)</TT> where <TT>w</TT> and <TT>h</TT> are the image size.
This is in fact the top right corner of pixel <TT>(w-1,h-1)</TT> which is the
image pixel with the highest coordinates.</BLOCKQUOTE>
