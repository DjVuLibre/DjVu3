<BLOCKQUOTE>
Files <TT>&quot;IW44Image.h&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;IW44Image.cpp&quot;</TT> implement the DjVu IW44 wavelet
scheme for the compression of gray-level images (see class IWBitmap)
and color images (see class IWPixmap).  Programs <!1><A HREF="c44.html">c44</A> and
<!1><A HREF="d44.html">d44</A> demonstrate how to encode and decode IW44 files.<P><B>IW44 File Structure</B> --- The IW44 files are structured according to
the EA IFF85 specifications (see <!1><A HREF="IFFByteStream.h.html">IFFByteStream.h</A>).  Gray level IW44
Images consist of a single <TT>&quot;FORM:BM44&quot;</TT> chunk composed of an arbitrary
number of <TT>&quot;BM44&quot;</TT> data chunks.  Color IW44 Images consist of a single
<TT>&quot;FORM:PM44&quot;</TT> chunk composed of an arbitrary number of <TT>&quot;PM44&quot;</TT> data
chunks.  The successive <TT>&quot;PM44&quot;</TT> or <TT>&quot;BM44&quot;</TT> data chunks contain
successive refinements of the encoded image.  Each chunk contains a
certain number of ``data slices''.  The first chunk also contains a small
image header.  You can use program <!1><A HREF="djvuinfo.2.html">djvuinfo</A> to display all this
structural information:

      FORM:PM44 [62598] 
        PM44 [10807]              #1 - 74 slices - v1.2 (color) - 684x510
        PM44 [23583]              #2 - 13 slices 
        PM44 [28178]              #3 - 10 slices 
    </PRE><P><B>Embedded IW44 Images</B> --- These IW44 data chunks can also appear within
other contexts.  Files representing a DjVu page, for instance, consist of
a single <TT>&quot;FORM:DJVU&quot;</TT> composite chunk.  This composite chunk may contain
<TT>&quot;BG44&quot;</TT> chunks encoding the background layer and <TT>&quot;FG44&quot;</TT> chunks encoding
the foreground color layer.  These <TT>&quot;BG44&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;FG44&quot;</TT> chunks are
actually regular IW44 data chunks with a different chunk identifier.  This
information too can be displayed using program <!1><A HREF="djvuinfo.2.html">djvuinfo</A>.

    </PRE><P><B>Performance</B> --- The main design objective for the DjVu wavelets
consisted of allowing progressive rendering and smooth scrolling of large
images with limited memory requirements.  Decoding functions process the
compressed data and update a memory efficient representation of the
wavelet coefficients.  Imaging function then can quickly render an
arbitrary segment of the image using the available data.  Both process can
be carried out in two threads of execution.  This design plays an
important role in the DjVu system.  We have investigated various
state-of-the-art wavelet compression schemes: although these schemes may
achieve slightly smaller file sizes, the decoding functions did not even
approach our requirements.  <P>The IW44 wavelets satisfy these requirements today. It performs very well
for quality settings resulting in high compression ratios.  It should not
be used for quasi-lossless compression because certain design choices
deliberately sacrifice the IW44 quasi-lossless performance in order to
improve the image quality at high compression ratios.<P>Little care however has been taken to make the IW44 encoder memory
efficient.  This code uses two copies of the wavelet coefficient data
structure (one for the raw coefficients, one for the quantized
coefficients).  A more sophisticated implementation should considerably
reduce the memory requirements.<P><B>Masking</B> --- When we create a DjVu image, we often know that certain
pixels of the background image are going to be covered by foreground
objects like text or drawings.  The DjVu IW44 wavelet decomposition
routine can use an optional bilevel image named the mask.  Every non zero
pixel in the mask means the value of the corresponding pixel in the
background image is irrelevant.  The wavelet decomposition code will
replace these masked pixels by a color value whose coding cost is minimal
(see <A HREF=http://www.research.att.com/~leonb/DJVU/mask>http://www.research.att.com/~leonb/DJVU/mask</A>).<P><B>ToDo</B> --- There are many improvements to be made.  Besides better
quantization algorithms (such as trellis quantization and bitrate
allocation), we should allow for more wavelet transforms.  These
improvements may be implemented in future version, if (and only if) they
can meet our decoding constraints.  Future versions will probably split
file <TT>&quot;IW44Image.cpp&quot;</TT> which currently contains everything.<P></BLOCKQUOTE>
