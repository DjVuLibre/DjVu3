<B>PNM</B> --- There are actually three PNM file formats: PBM for bilevel
images, PGM for gray level images, and PPM for color images.  These
formats are widely used by popular image manipulation packages such as
NetPBM <A HREF=http://www.arc.umn.edu/GVL/Software/netpbm.html>http://www.arc.umn.edu/GVL/Software/netpbm.html</A> or
ImageMagick <A HREF=http://www.wizards.dupont.com/cristy/>http://www.wizards.dupont.com/cristy/</A>.<P><B>RLE</B> --- The binary RLE file format is a simple run-length encoding
scheme for storing bilevel images.  Encoding or decoding a RLE encoded
file is extremely simple. Yet RLE encoded files are usually much smaller
than the corresponding PBM encoded files.  RLE files always begin with a
header line composed of:<BR>
- the two characters <TT>&quot;R4&quot;</TT>,<BR>
- one or more blank characters,<BR>
- the number of columns, encoded using characters <TT>&quot;0&quot;</TT> to <TT>&quot;9&quot;</TT>,<BR>
- one or more blank characters,<BR>
- the number of lines, encoded using characters <TT>&quot;0&quot;</TT> to <TT>&quot;9&quot;</TT>,<BR>
- exactly one blank character (usually a line-feed character).<P>The rest of the file encodes a sequence of numbers representing the
lengths of alternating runs of white and black pixels.  Lines are encoded
starting with the top line and progressing towards the bottom line.  Each
line starts with a white run. The decoder knows that a line is finished
when the sum of the run lengths for that line is equal to the number of
columns in the image.  Numbers in range <TT>0</TT> to <TT>191</TT> are represented by a
single byte in range <TT>0x00</TT> to <TT>0xbf</TT>.  Numbers in range <TT>192</TT> to <TT>16383</TT>
are represented by a two byte sequence: the first byte, in range <TT>0xc0</TT> to
<TT>0xff</TT>, encodes the six most significant bits of the number, the second
byte encodes the remaining eight bits of the number. This scheme allows
for runs of length zero, which are useful when a line starts with a black
pixel, and when a very long run (whose length exceeds <TT>16383</TT>) must be
split into smaller runs.<P></BLOCKQUOTE>
