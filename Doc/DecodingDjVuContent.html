<A NAME="DOC.DOCU">
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Classes <!1><A HREF="DjVuImage.html">DjVuImage</A> and <!1><A HREF="DjVuDocument.html">DjVuDocument</A> provide the preferred way
to decode the contents of a DjVu file.  The complete documentation is
found in section <!1><A HREF="DjVuDocument.h.html">DjVuDocument.h</A>, <!1><A HREF="DjVuImage.h.html">DjVuImage.h</A> and
<!1><A HREF="DjVuFile.html">DjVuFile</A>.  You may also consult the source code of programs
<!1><A HREF="ddjvu.html">ddjvu</A> and djvm.<P>The DjVu Reference Library uses a two stage decoding model. 
<UL>
<LI> The first stage, called <EM>decoding</EM>, consists of analyzing a DjVu
or IW44 file and constructing a partially decoded representation of
the image in memory.  This partially decoded representation requires
much less memory (typically 1-2 MBytes) than the raw image
(typically 20-30 MBytes).  
<LI> The second stage, called <EM>rendering</EM>, consists of using this
representation to recreate the pixels for any part of the image at
any resolution.  You should render <EM>on-the-fly</EM> the part of the
image that you actually wish to display.  This strategy minimizes
both the memory and the computational requirements.
</UL><P>An example of decoding a multipage DjVu document is shown below.
First you create <!1><A HREF="DjVuDocument.html">DjVuDocument</A> and call
<!1><A HREF="DjVuDocument.html#DOC.1.4.30.1.6">init</A> with a proper file URL.  This function
starts a thread which decodes the document structure (i.e. the
number of pages, the page names, etc.).  You can use function
<!1><A HREF="DjVuDocument.html#DOC.1.4.30.1.19">wait_for_complete_init</A> to wait for the
termination of this thread and check its result.  Then you can use
function <!1><A HREF="DjVuDocument.html#DOC.1.4.30.1.18.5">get_page</A> to obtain a <!1><A HREF="DjVuImage.html">DjVuImage</A>
for a given page number.  This function starts a thread which
decodes the image data. Again you can call function
<!1><A HREF="DjVuImage.html#DOC.1.4.32.1.14.1">wait_for_complete_decode</A> to wait for the
termination of this thread and check its result.<P><PRE>
      GP&lt;DjVuDocument&gt; doc = new DjVuDocument;
      // Decode the document structure
      doc-&gt;init(GOS::filename_to_url(&quot;file.djvu&quot;));
      if (! doc-&gt;wait_for_complete_init())
        THROW(&quot;A decoding error has occured&quot;);      
      // Decode a page
      GP&lt;DjVuImage&gt; dimg = doc-&gt;get_page(2);
      if (! dimg-&gt;wait_for_complete_decode() )
        THROW(&quot;A decoding error has occured&quot;);
    </PRE><P>Note: When the reference library is compiled without threads, both functions
<!1><A HREF="DjVuDocument.html#DOC.1.4.30.1.6">init</A> and <!1><A HREF="DjVuDocument.html#DOC.1.4.30.1.18.5">get_page</A> perform their
task before returning.  The functions <!1><A HREF="DjVuDocument.html#DOC.1.4.30.1.19">wait_for_complete_init</A>
and <!1><A HREF="DjVuImage.html#DOC.1.4.32.1.14.1">wait_for_complete_decode</A> do not wait, but are still
useful for testing that the operation was successful.<P>The sample rendering code below may be called whenever you need to
redisplay part of a window showing DjVu image.  Class <!1><A HREF="GRect.html">GRect</A> is used
to represent two rectangles of interest. Rectangle <TT>full</TT> represents the
range of pixels that would be occupied by the full DjVu image. This
rectangle may be much larger than your computer screen.  The ratio between
the size of this rectangle and the size of the image implicitly defines
the resolution of the displayed image.  Rectangle <TT>part</TT> represents the
range of pixel that you actually want to compute.  This rectangle always
corresponds to a visible portion of your screen.  The functions
<!1><A HREF="DjVuImage.html#DOC.1.4.32.1.18.1">get_pixmap</A> and <!1><A HREF="DjVuImage.html#DOC.1.4.32.1.18.2">get_bitmap</A> return a
"smart" <!1><A HREF="GP.html">GP</A> pointer to either a <!1><A HREF="GPixmap.html">GPixmap</A> or <!1><A HREF="GBitmap.html">GBitmap</A>
containing the requested pixels.
<PRE>
       GRect part = my_rectangle_to_redisplay();
       GRect full = my_rectangle_for_the_full_image();
       // Try rendering in color
       GP&lt;GPixmap&gt; pm = img-&gt;get_pixmap(part, full);
       if (pm) { my_display_in_color(pm); return; }
       // Try rendering in gray
       GP&lt;GBitmap&gt; bm = img-&gt;get_bitmap(part, full);
       if (bm) { my_display_in_grays(bm); return ; }
    </PRE><P>This is the easiest way to decode and render a DjVu document
stored in the filesystem. <!1><A HREF="DjVuDocument.html">DjVuDocument</A> accesses all the
required and prints all potential error messages directly to
<TT>stderr</TT>.<P>In a more complex environment you may want to have more control on
where the data is coming from and where status and error messages
are directed.  By definining a subclass of <!1><A HREF="DjVuPort.html">DjVuPort</A>, you can
receive notifications from the decoding threads.  These
notifications allow you to provide data from various sources, to
know about various error conditions, and to know when enough data
has been decoded to display a preliminary version of the image.<P>Progressive display, for instance, can be implemented by letting
the decoding threads run in the background.  These threads wait
for data and process it as soon as possible.  The main thread
handles the user interface and can call the rendering functions at
any time while the decoding is in progress.  These function will
render the best possible image given the amount of data currently
received (or simply return 0 if no rendering is possible yet).
The <!1><A HREF="DjVuPort.html">DjVuPort</A> notification mechanism allows you to determine
when enough data has been received to justify redisplaying an
updated version of the image.<P>Section <!1><A HREF="GThreads.h.html">GThreads.h</A> discusses the multi-threading capabilities of the
DjVu Reference Library.  These features must be enabled at compile-time
using the adequate option of the configuration script.  <P><B>Note:</B> In previous versions of the library, decoding was
achieved by calling function <!1><A HREF="DjVuImage.html#DOC.1.4.32.1.15.1">decode</A> in class
<!1><A HREF="DjVuImage.html">DjVuImage</A>.  This method has been made obsolete by the
introduction of multipage DjVu documents and <TT>INCL</TT> chunks.  The
decoder has to handle more than one stream of incoming data and
should be able to keep track of relationships between different
files in the same document.  All this activity is now orchestrated
by class <!1><A HREF="DjVuDocument.html">DjVuDocument</A>.  </BLOCKQUOTE>
