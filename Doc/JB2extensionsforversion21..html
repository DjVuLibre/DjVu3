<BLOCKQUOTE>Extensions to the JB2 format introduced in version 21.  </BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="DOC.DOCU">
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Two extensions of the JB2 encoding format have been introduced
with DjVu files version 21.  Both extensions maintain significant
backward compatibility with previous version of the JB2 format.
These extensions are described below by reference to the ICFDD
proposal dated August 1999.  Both extension make use of the unused
record type value <TT>9</TT> (cf. ICFDD page 24) which has been renamed
<TT>REQUIRED_DICT_OR_RESET</TT>.<P><B>Shared Shape Dictionaries</B> --- This extension provides
support for sharing symbol definitions between the pages of a
document.  To achieve this objective, the JB2 image data chunk
must be able to address symbols defined elsewhere by a JB2
dictionary data chunk shared by all the pages of a document.<P>The arithmetically encoded JB2 image data logically consist of a
sequence of records. The decoder processes these records in
sequence and maintains a library of symbols which can be addressed
by the following records.  The first record usually is a ``Start
Of Image'' record describing the size of the image.<P>Starting with version 21, a <TT>REQUIRED_DICT_OR_RESET</TT> (9) record
type can appear <EM>before</EM> the <TT>START_OF_DATA</TT> (0) record.  The
record type field is followed by a single number arithmetically
encoded (cf. ICFDD page 26) using a sixteenth context (cf. ICFDD
page 25).  This record appears when the JB2 data chunk requires
symbols encoded in a separate JB2 dictionary data chunk.  The
number (the <B>dictionary size</B>) indicates how many symbols
should have been defined by the JB2 dictionary data chunk.  The
decoder should simply load these symbols in the symbol library and
proceed as usual.  New symbols potentially defined by the
subsequent JB2 image data records will therefore be numbered with
integers greater or equal than the dictionary size.<P>The JB2 dictionary data format is a pure subset of the JB2 image
data format.  The <TT>START_OF_DATA</TT> (0) record always specifies an
image width of zero and an image height of zero.  The only allowed
record types are those defining library symbols only
(<TT>NEW_SYMBOL_LIBRARY_ONLY</TT> (2) and <TT>MATCHED_REFINE_LIBRARY_ONLY</TT>
(5) cf. ICFDD page 24) followed by a final <TT>END_OF_DATA</TT> (11)
record.<P>The JB2 dictionary data is usually located in an <B>Djbz</B> chunk.
Each page <B>FORM:DJVU</B> may directly contain a <B>Djbz</B> chunk,
or may indirectly point to such a chunk using an <B>INCL</B> chunk
(cf. <!1><A HREF="MultipageDjVudocuments..html">Multipage DjVu documents.</A>).<P>
<B>Numcoder Reset</B> --- This extension addresses a problem for
hardware implementations.  The encoding of numbers (cf. ICFDD page
26) potentially uses an unbounded number of binary coding
contexts. These contexts are normally allocated when they are used
for the first time (cf. ICFDD informative note, page 27).<P>Starting with version 21, a <TT>REQUIRED_DICT_OR_RESET</TT> (9) record
type can appear <EM>after</EM> the <TT>START_OF_DATA</TT> (0) record.  The
decoder should proceed with the next record after <EM>clearing
all binary contexts used for coding numbers</EM>.  This operation
implies that all binary contexts previously allocated for coding
numbers can be deallocated.<P>Starting with version 21, the JB2 encoder should insert a
<TT>REQUIRED_DICT_OR_RESET</TT> record type whenever the number of these
allocated binary contexts exceeds <TT>20000</TT>.  Only very large
documents ever reach such a large number of allocated binary
contexts (e.g large maps).  Hardware implementation however can
benefit greatly from a hard bound on the total number of binary
coding contexts.  Old JB2 decoders will treat this record type as
an <TT>END_OF_DATA</TT> record and cleanly stop decoding (cf. ICFDD page
30, Image refinement data).<P>
