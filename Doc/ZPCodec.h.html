<BLOCKQUOTE>
Files <TT>&quot;ZPCodec.h&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;ZPCodec.cpp&quot;</TT> implement a fast binary adaptive
quasi-arithmetic coder named ZP-Coder.  Because of its speed and
convenience, the ZP-Coder is used in several parts of the DjVu reference
library (See <!1><A HREF="BSByteStream.h.html">BSByteStream.h</A>, <!1><A HREF="JB2Image.h.html">JB2Image.h</A>, <!1><A HREF="IW44Image.h.html">IW44Image.h</A>).
The following comments avoid the theory (see the historical remarks for
useful pointers) and concentrate on the user perspective on the ZP-Coder.<P><B>Introduction</B> ---
Encoding consists of transforming a sequence of <EM>message bits</EM> into a
sequence of <EM>code bits</EM>. Decoding consists of retrieving the message
bits using only the code bits.  We can make the code smaller than the
message as soon as we can predict a message bit on the basis of a <EM>
coding context</EM> composed of previously encoded or decoded bits. If the
prediction is always correct, we do not even need to encode the message
bit. If the prediction is totally unreliable, we need to generate one code
bit in order to unambiguously specify the message bit.  In other words,
the more reliable the prediction, the more compression we get.<P>The ZP-Coder handles prediction by means of <EM>context variables</EM> (see
<!1><A HREF="BitContext.html">BitContext</A>).  There must be a context variable for each possible
combination of context bits.  Both the encoder and the decoder use same
context variable for coding each message bit.  For instance, we can code a
binary image by successively coding all the pixels (the message bits) in
row and column order.  It is reasonable to assume that each pixel can be
reasonably well predicted by looking at a few (say 10) neighboring pixels
located above and to the left of the current pixel.  Since these 10 pixels
make 1024 combinations, we need 1024 context variables. Each pixel is
encoded using the context variable corresponding to the values of the 10
neighboring pixels.  Each pixel will be decoded by specifying the same
context variable corresponding to the values of these 10 pixels. This is
possible because these 10 pixels (located above and to the left) have
already been decoded and therefore are known by the decoder program.<P>The context variables are initially set to zero, which mean that we do not
know yet how to predict the current message bit on the basis of the
context bits. While coding the message bits, the ZP-Coder automatically
estimates the frequencies of <TT>0</TT>s and <TT>1</TT>s coded using each context
variable.  These frequencies actually provide a prediction (the most
probable bit value) and an estimation of the prediction reliability (how
often the prediction was correct in the past).  All this statistical
information is stored into the context variable after coding each bit.  In
other words, the more we code bits within a particular context, the better
the ZP-Coder adapts its prediction model, and the more compression we can
obtain.<P>All this adaptation works indeed because both the encoder program and the
decoder program are always synchronized. Both the encoder and the decoder
see the same message bits encoded (or decoded) with the same context
variables.  Both the encoder and the decoder apply the same rules to
update the context variables and improve the predictors.  Both the encoder
and the decoder programs use the same predictors for any given message
bit.  The decoder could not work if this was not the case.<P>Just before encoding a message bit, all the context variables in the
encoder program contain certain values. Just before decoding this message
bit, all the context variables in the decoder program must contain the same
values as for the encoder program.  This is guaranteed as long as
each prediction only depends on already coded bits: <EM>the coding context,
on which the each prediction is based, must be composed of message bits which
have already been coded. </EM><P><B>Usage</B> ---
Once you know how to organize the predictions (i.e. which coding context
to use, how many context variables to initialize, etc.), using the
ZP-Coder is straightforward (see <!1><A HREF="ZPCodecExamples.html">ZPCodec Examples</A>):
<UL>
<LI> The <EM>encoder program</EM> allocates context variables and
initializes them to zero. It then constructs a <!1><A HREF="ZPCodec.html">ZPCodec</A> object for
encoding. For each message bit, the encoder program retrieves the context
bits, selects a context variable on the basis of the context bits and
calls member function <!1><A HREF="ZPCodec.html#DOC.1.4.17.2.2">encoder</A> with the message bit and a
reference to the context variable.
<LI> The <EM>decoder program</EM> allocates context variables and
initializes them to zero. It then constructs a <!1><A HREF="ZPCodec.html">ZPCodec</A> object for
decoding. For each message bit, the decoder program retrieves the context
bits, selects a context variable on the basis of the context bits and
calls member function <!1><A HREF="ZPCodec.html#DOC.1.4.17.2.5">decoder</A> with a reference to the
context variable. This function returns the message bit.
</UL>
Functions
perform two essential tasks, namely <EM>coding</EM> and <EM>context
adaptation</EM>.  Function <TT>decoder</TT> often returns after two arithmetic
operations only.  To make your program fast, you just need to feed message
bits and context variables fast enough.<P><B>History</B> --- The ZP-Coder is similar in function and performance to
the seminal Q-Coder (Pennebaker, Mitchell, Langdon, Arps, IBM J. Res
Dev. 32, 1988). An improved version of the Q-Coder, named QM-Coder, has
been described in certain parts of the JPEG standard.  Unfortunate patent
policies have made these coders very difficult to use in general purpose
applications.  The Z-Coder is constructed using a new approach based on an
extension of the Golomb codes (Bottou, Howard, Bengio, IEEE DCC 98, 1998
<A HREF=http://www.research.att.com/~leonb/DJVU/bottou-howard-bengio/>DjVu</A>
<A HREF=http://www.research.att.com/~leonb/PS/bottou-howard-bengio.ps.gz>PostScript</A>)
This new approach does not infringe the QM-Coder patents.  Unfortunately
the Z-Coder is dangerously close to the patented Arithmetic MEL Coder.
Therefore we wrote the ZP-Coder (pronounce Zee-Prime Coder) which we
believe is clear of legal problems.  Needless to say, AT&amp;T has patents
pending for both the Z-Coder and the ZP-Coder, licenced to LizardTech.
The good news however is that we can grant a license to use the ZP-Coder
in ``free software'' without further complication. See the Copyright
for more information.<P></BLOCKQUOTE>
