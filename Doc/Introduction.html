<B>DjVu Technology</B> --- Over 90 percent of the information in the world
is still on paper. Many of those paper documents include color graphics
and/or photographs that represent significant invested value. And almost
none of that rich content is on the Internet.  That's because scanning
such documents and getting them onto a Web site has been problematic at
best. At the high resolution necessary to preserve the quality of images
and to keep type readable, file sizes become far too bulky for acceptable
download speed. Reducing resolution to achieve satisfactory download speed
means forfeiting quality and legibility. Conventional JPEG and GIF
compression techniques only begin to solve the problem. As a result, Web
site content developers have been unable to leverage existing printed
materials.<P>The DjVu image compression technology <A HREF=http://www.lizardtech.com/>http://www.lizardtech.com/</A>
addresses this problem.  Content developers can scan high-resolution color
pages of books, magazines, catalogs, manuals, historical or ancient
documents.  The DjVu document format provides the means to compress these
bulky images to a size comparable to that of an HTML page.  Content
providers and consumers around the world can leverage the incredible
wealth of information and images that were previously trapped in hard copy
form. DjVu is the enabling technology that will deliver on the promise of
the Internet as the world's universal library.<P>There are in fact three kinds of DjVu image files:
<DL>
<DT><B>Photo DjVu Image.</B><DD>
Photo DjVu Image files are best used for encoding photographic images
in colors or in shades of gray.  The images are coded using the IW44
wavelet representation optimized for fast progressive rendering.
<DT><B>Bilevel DjVu Image.</B><DD>
Bilevel DjVu Image files are best used to compress black and white
images representing text and simple drawings.  The JB2 data compression
model uses a the "soft pattern matching" technique which essentially
consists of encoding each character by describing how it differs from a
well chosen already encoded character.
<DT><B>Compound DjVu Image.</B><DD>
Compound DjVu Image files are an extremely efficient way to compress
high resolution color document images containing both pictures and
text, such as a page of a magazine.  Compound DjVu Images represent the
document images using two layers.  The <EM>background layer</EM> is used
for encoding the pictures and the paper texture.  The <EM>foreground
layer</EM> is used for encoding the text and the drawings.
</DL>
In addition we often use <B>IW44 Image</B> files. This is the native format
for the IW44 wavelet representation. These files have the same uses then
Photo DjVu Images but use a simpler file format.  There are two variants of
IW44 files for gray level images and color images.<P><B>DjVu Reference Library</B> --- The DjVu Reference Library implements the
components of the DjVu technology that are essential for the definition of
the file formats.  <P>This source code release serves three purposes:
<UL>
<LI> It demonstrates our intention to create a lasting technology.
Regardless of LizardTech's involvement, developers around the world
now have a permanent access to critical parts of DjVu technology.
<LI> It allows developers around the world to work with the DjVu
technology, to create new advances using our basic building blocks, to
create bridges between DjVu and other document representation formats,
to create viewers for various platforms, etc.
<LI> It provides an authoritative implementation of the DjVu format
for standardization purposes.
</UL><P>The DjVu Reference Library is the first component of DjVu released in
source code form.  The DjVu Reference Library completely defines the DjVu
and IW44 image formats.  It does not implement however the sophisticated
encoding strategies which allow for the highest compression ratios.  These
strategies however are very application dependent.  We have developed
encoders for scanned documents (see <A HREF=http://www.lizardtech.com/djvu>http://www.lizardtech.com/djvu</A>.  We
also know that completely different (and probably much easier) encoding
strategies are needed for electronically created documents.<P>We intend to keep releasing new versions of this library and additional
software such as viewers and encoders.  Using the currently released code,
you can <EM>easily</EM> do the following:
<UL>
<LI> <EM>Decoding</EM> DjVu and IW44 images.
<LI> <EM>Rendering</EM> DjVu or IW44 image fragments at any resolution.
<LI> <EM>Encode IW44 wavelet images</EM>.
</UL>
The following tasks can be achieved with an increasing effort level.  
The documentation somehow explains the basic ideas, but this is 
not currently implemented:
<UL>
<LI> <EM>Creating DjVu Photo Images</EM> which are basically embedded IW44
images according to the instructions in djvumake.
<LI> <EM>Creating Lossless Bilevel DjVu Images</EM> using lossless encoding.
Instructions are provided in <!1><A HREF="JB2Image.h.html">JB2Image.h</A> and djvumake.
Lossless encoding should be very efficient with electronically
produced documents (since the character shapes are perfectly
defined). A DVI to DJVU program comes to mind ...
<LI> <EM>Creating Compound DjVu Images for Electronically Produced Images</EM>.
Just combine the above task with the masking technique described in
djvumake.  A GIMP to DJVU filter comes to mind ...
<LI> <EM>Creating DjVu Images from Scans</EM>.  The most difficult part
involves the separation of the foreground and the background.  A
simple thresholding works on half the documents and fails miserably
on the second half.  Creating a robust solution is not easy at all.
</UL><P>We do not plan to publish soon the source code pertaining to the DjVu
compression of scanned images.  We may provide the source code of older
versions.  We also provide executables for personal uses.  We license this
technology to business partners who commit to support the DjVu format.
Releasing this code today would negatively affect the business of our
partners and eventually reduce the dissemination of the DjVu technology.<P>We think that this is preferable to the Java alternative where the license
mandates that you cannot use the software unless your work fully complies
with the Java specifications.  We think that we should not prevent people
from using our code for completely different purposes.  In other words, we
prefer to release less software but make it really <EM>free</EM> (in the sense
of <EM>free speech</EM> not <EM>free lunch</EM> as you probably know.)  </BLOCKQUOTE>
