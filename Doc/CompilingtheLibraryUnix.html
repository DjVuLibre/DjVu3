<A NAME="DOC.DOCU">
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Directories</B> --- The structure of the distribution is essentially
flat.  All the source code files, for both the library and the utility
programs, are found in the main directory <TT>&quot;libdjvu++&quot;</TT>.  A few
subdirectories contain accessory material.  Directory <TT>&quot;Doc&quot;</TT> contains
the HTML documentation generated from the source files.  Directory
<TT>&quot;Samples&quot;</TT> contains sample DjVu files for testing purposes.  Directory
<TT>&quot;Test&quot;</TT> contains a few test programs for the library basic features.<P><B>Prerequisites</B> --- The DjVu Reference Library should compile and run
on any well behaved Unix system, <EM>provided that you use a good C++
compiler</EM> supporting templates, exceptions and possibly multithreading.
Workstation makers usually provide good compilers.  You can certainly
compile and run the library with these compilers if you find out which
options apply to your system and your particular version of the compiler.
We find that there are just too many different compilers around.  This is
why we recommend using <TT>gcc</TT> or<P>You can safely proceed to the compilation if you have <TT>gcc-2.8.x</TT> or any
version
out what is installed on your system.  If you have an earlier version of
<TT>g++</TT> such as <TT>gcc-2.7.23</TT>, you must upgrade because it is not going to
work.  We strongly recommend upgrading directly to
The easiest way consists of picking a binary distribution somewhere on the
Internet.  Linux users may have a look at <A HREF=http://www.gcc.ml.org>http://www.gcc.ml.org</A> or
<A HREF=http://rufus.w3.org/linux/RPM>http://rufus.w3.org/linux/RPM</A>.<P><B>Building your compiler (advanced)</B> --- You should really skip this
section if you can avoid reading it.  You should only read it if (a) you
cannot find a suitable binary distribution of
experiment with the multi-threading features of the library.<P>Building the
systems uses GNU Make by default.  Many Unix systems provide GNU Make
under the name <TT>gmake</TT>.  You must otherwise download the source code at
<A HREF=ftp://gatekeeper.dec.com/pub/GNU/make>ftp://gatekeeper.dec.com/pub/GNU/make</A> or
<A HREF=ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu>ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu</A>, unpack it, read the instructions,
compile and install.<P>You must then download the source distribution of the latest release of<P><TT>&quot;egcs/gcc/libgcc2.c&quot;</TT> which is required by our multi-threading code.
You can apply the patch using command <TT>patch</TT>. 
<PRE>
      % cd egcs/gcc
      % patch &lt; $HOME/libdjvu++/@Tools/libgcc2.c.diff
      Patching file libgcc2.c using Plan A...
      Hunk #1 succeeded at 3063.
      Hunk #2 succeeded at 3118.
      done

This patch has been tested with
We hope that the EGCS people will either include the patch in their future
releases, or provide a similar capability.  If anything suspicious happens
during the patching process, we suggest that you restore the original
version of <TT>&quot;libgcc2.c&quot;</TT> which is automatically saved as
<TT>&quot;libgcc2.c.orig&quot;</TT>.<P>You must then configure and compile
described at <A HREF=http://egcs.cygnus.com>http://egcs.cygnus.com</A>.  I could use for instance the
following commands on my SGI workstation running Irix-6.5:
<PRE>
      % cd egcs
      % configure --prefix=$HOME/egcs  mips-sgi-irix-5.3
      % gnu-make
      % gnu-make install
    </PRE>
You are reading correctly: We are pretending that the workstation has
Irix-5.3 because we want to create backward compatible binaries.  Welcome
to the wonderful world of compilers.<P><B>Compiling the DjVu Reference Library</B> --- Compiling the DjVu
Reference Library is a two step process.  You must first invoke the script
<TT>configure</TT> which searches the compiler, selects the compilation options
and creates the makefiles.
<PRE>
       % configure --prefix=$HOME/djvu
    </PRE><P>You can specify a particular compiler by setting environment variable
<TT>CXX</TT> before invoking the configuration script. This script also 
supports the following options:
<DL>
<DT><B>--prefix=PREFIXDIR</B><DD> indicates where the binary files will be installed.
<DT><B>--with-debug</B><DD> enables the debugging options of the compiler.
<DT><B>--with-cxxflag=FLAG</B><DD> passes a particular option to the compiler.
<DT><B>--without-threads</B><DD> disables multi-threading (the default).
<DT><B>--with-threads=(cothreads,posix,dce)</B><DD> enables multithreading and
selects a multithreading implementation (see <!1><A HREF="GThreads.h.html">GThreads.h</A>). You
must make sure that your C++ compiler is compatible with the chosen
thread implementation.  The safest option consists of using the
patched version of
implementation.
</DL><P>You are now ready to compile and install everything by typing:
<PRE>
       % make all
       % make install
    </PRE><P><B>Using the DjVu Reference Library</B> --- At this point, you have
generated a collection of small executables documented in section
<!1><A HREF="UtilityPrograms.html">Utility Programs</A>.  This is not very exciting.  It is now time to
remember that the DjVu Reference Library is a source code library.  Almost
everything you can use safely is documented in section 
<!1><A HREF="LibraryReference.html">Library Reference</A>.  You may want however to start with 
section <!1><A HREF="DecodingDjVuContent.html">Decoding DjVu Content</A>.  </BLOCKQUOTE>
