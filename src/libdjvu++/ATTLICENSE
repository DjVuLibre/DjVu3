[THIS IS A MEANINGLESS DRAFT]


This is an agreement (the "Agreement") between ... yek!

1. DEFINITIONS 	

For the purposes of this Agreement, the following definitions shall apply: I
chose to put most of the ideas into the definitions. That makes a set of
rather independent statements on which I can test the logic of the license.

1.1. "Source Code" shall mean the preferred form of a work for modification of
correction of the work.  For an executable software, Source Code means all the
source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation of the
executable.  

1.2. "Original Contributor" shall mean any person or entity who creates and
distributes an original software in Source Code form (the "Original Software")
which contains a notice saying that this work may be used in accordance with
the AT&T Labs Public License.

1.3. "Adaptation" of a software shall mean any work based on the software,
including (a) any work which incorporates all or part of the software, (b) any
work which includes modifications to the software, including but not limited
to bug fixes, (c) any work which would be deemed a derivative work of the
software pursuant to United States copyright law.
