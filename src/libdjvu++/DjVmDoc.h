/** Read/Write DjVu multipage documents.

    The "new" DjVu multipage documents can be of two types: {\em bundled} and
    {\em indirect}. In the first case all pages are packed into one file,
    which is very like an archive internally. In the second case every page
    is stored in a separate file. Plus there can be other components,
    included into one or more pages, which also go into separate files. In
    addition to pages and components, in the case of the {\em indirect} format
    there is one more top-level file with the document directory (see
    \Ref{DjVmDir}), which is basically an index file containing the
    list of all files composing the document.

    This class can read documents of both formats and can save them under any
    format.  It is therefore ideal for converting between {\em bundled} and
    {\em indirect} formats.  It cannot be used however for reading obsolete
    formats.  The best way to convert obsolete formats consists in reading
    them with class \Ref{DjVuDocument} class and saving them using
    \Ref{DjVuDocument::write} or \Ref{DjVuDocument::expand}.

    This class can also be used to create and modify multipage documents at
    the low level without decoding every page or component (See
    \Ref{insert_file}() and \Ref{delete_file}()).
