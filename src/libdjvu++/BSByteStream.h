/** @name BSByteStream.h
    
    Files #"BSByteStream.h"# and #"BSByteStream.cpp"# implement a very compact
    general purpose compressor based on the Burrows-Wheeler transform.  The
    utility program \Ref{bzz} provides a front-end for this class. Although
    this compression model is not currently used in DjVu files, it may be used
    in the future for encoding textual data chunks.

    {\bf Algorithms} --- The Burrows-Wheeler transform (also named Block-Sorting)
    is performed using a combination of the Karp-Miller-Rosenberg and the
    Bentley-Sedgewick algorithms. This is comparable to (Sadakane, DCC 98)
    with a slightly more flexible ranking scheme. Symbols are then ordered
    according to a running estimate of their occurrence frequencies.  The
    symbol ranks are then coded using a simple fixed tree and the
    \Ref{ZPCodec} binary adaptive coder.

    {\bf Performances} --- The basic algorithm is mostly similar to those
    implemented in well known compressors like #bzip# or #bzip2#
    (\URL{http://www.muraroa.demon.co.uk}).  The adaptive binary coder however
    generates small differences. The adaptation noise may cost up to 5\% in
    file size, but this penalty is usually offset by the benefits of
    adaptation.  This is good when processing large and highly structured
    files like spreadsheet files.  Compression and decompression speed is
    about twice slower than #bzip2# but the sorting algorithms is more
    robust. Unlike #bzip2# (as of August 1998), this code can compress half a
    megabyte of "abababab...." in bounded time.
    
    Here are some comparative results (in bits per character) obtained on the
    Canterbury Corpus (\URL{http://corpus.canterbury.ac.nz}) as of August
    1998. The BSByteStream performance on the single spreadsheet file #Excl#
    moves #bzz#'s weighted average ahead of much more sophisticated methods,
    like Suzanne Bunton's #fsmxBest# system
    \URL{http://corpus.canterbury.ac.nz/methodinfo/fsmx.html}.  This result
    will not last very long.

    Note that the DjVu people have several entries in this table.  Program
    #compress# was written some time ago by Joe Orost
    (\URL{http://www.research.att.com/info/orost}). The #ppmc# method, (a
    precursor of #ppmd#) was created by Paul Howard
    (\URL{http://www.research.att.com/info/pgh}). The #bzz# program is just
    below your eyes.

/** Performs bzz compression/decompression.
    
    Class #BSByteStream# defines a \Ref{ByteStream} which transparently
    performs the BZZ compression/decompression. The constructor of class
    \Ref{BSByteStream} takes another \Ref{ByteStream} as argument.  Any data
    written to the BSByteStream is compressed and written to this second
    ByteStream. Any data read from the BSByteStream is internally generated by
    decompressing data read from the second ByteStream.

    Program \Ref{bzz} demonstrates how to use this class.  All the hard work
    is achieved by a simple ByteStream to ByteStream copy, as shown below.
    \begin{verbatim}
      GP<ByteStream> in=ByteStream::create(infile,"rb");
      GP<ByteStream> out=ByteStream::create(outfile,"wb");
      if (encoding) {
          BSByteStream bsb(out, blocksize);
          bsb.copy(*in);
      } else {
          BSByteStream bsb(in);
          out->copy(bsb);
      }
    \end{verbatim}
    Due to the block oriented nature of the Burrows-Wheeler transform, there
    is a very significant latency between the data input and the data output.
    You can use function #flush# to force data output at the expense of
    compression efficiency.

    You should never directly access a ByteStream object connected to a valid
    BSByteStream object. The ByteStream object can be accessed again after the
    destruction of the BSByteStream object.  Note that the encoder always
    flushes its internal buffers and writes a few final code bytes when the
    BSByteStream object is destroyed.  Note also that the decoder often reads
    a few bytes beyond the last code byte written by the encoder.  This lag
    means that you must reposition the ByteStream after the destruction of the
    BSByteStream object and before re-using the ByteStream object (see
    \Ref{IFFByteStream}.)

      kilobytes).  Using a larger block size usually increases the compression
      ratio at the expense of computation time.  There is no need however to
      specify a block size larger than the total number of bytes to compress.
      Setting #blocksize# to #1024# is a good starting point.  A minimal block
