    This file is included by all include files in the DjVu reference library.
    It does nothing unless compilation symbols #NEED_DJVU_MEMORY#,

    symbols enable features which are useful for certain applications of the
    DjVu Reference Library.  These features are still experimental and

/** @name DjVu Progress  

    This section is enabled when compilation symbol #NEED_DJVU_PROGRESS# is
    defined.  This macro setups callback function that may be used to
    implement a progress indicator for the encoding routines.  The decoding
    routines do not need such a facility because it is sufficient to monitor
    the calls to function \Ref{ByteStream::read} in class \Ref{ByteStream}.
    
    {\bf Code tracing macros} ---
    Monitoring the progress of such complex algorithms requires significant
    code support.  This is achieved by inserting {\em code tracing macros}
    in strategic regions of the code.  
    \begin{description}
    \item[DJVU_PROGRESS_TASK(name,nsteps)]  indicates that the current
         scope performs a task roughly divided in #nsteps# equal steps.
    \item[DJVU_PROGRESS_RUN(name,tostep)] indicates that we are starting
         an operation which will take us to step #tostep#.  The operation
         will be considered finished when #DJVU_PROGRESS_RUN# will be called
         again with an argument greater than #tostep#.  The execution of
         this operation of course can be described by one subtask and so on.
    \end{description}
 
    {\bf Progress callback} --- The progresss callback function
    #DjVuProgressTask::callback# should be defined {\em before defining the
    outermost task}.  This function is called periodically with two #unsigned
    long# arguments.  The first argument is the elapsed time. The second
    argument is the estimated total execution time.  Both times are given in
    milliseconds.  */
