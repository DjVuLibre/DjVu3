/** @name DjVmDir.h
    Files #"DjVmDir.h"# and #"DjVmDir.cpp"# implement class \Ref{DjVmDir} for
    representing the directory of a DjVu multipage document.

    {\bf Bundled vs. Indirect format} --- There are currently two multipage
    DjVu formats supported: {\em bundled} and {\em indirect}.  In the first
    format all component files composing a given document are packaged (or
    bundled) into one file, in the second one every page and component is
    stored in a separate file and there is one more file, which contains the
    list of all others.

    {\bf Multipage DjVu format} --- Multipage DjVu documents follow the EA
    IFF85 format (cf. \Ref{IFFByteStream.h}.)  A document is composed of a
    #"FORM:DJVM"# whose first chunk is a #"DIRM"# chunk containing the {\em
    document directory}.  This directory lists all component files composing
    the given document, helps to access every component file and identify the
    pages of the document.
    \begin{itemize} 
    \item In a {\em bundled} multipage file, the component files 
         are stored immediately after the #"DIRM"# chunk,
         within the #"FORM:DJVU"# composite chunk.  
    \item In an {\em indirect} multipage file, the component files are 
          stored in different files whose URLs are composed using information 
          stored in the #"DIRM"# chunk.
    \end{itemize} 
    Most of the component files represent pages of a document.  Some files
    however represent data shared by several pages.  The pages refer to these
    supporting files by means of an inclusion chunk (#"INCL"# chunks)
    identifying the supporting file.

    {\bf Document Directory} --- Every directory record describes a component
    file.  Each component file is identified by a small string named the
    identifier (ID).  Each component file also contains a file name and a
    title.  The format of the #"DIRM"# chunk is described in section
    \Ref{Format of the DIRM chunk.}.

    Theoretically, IDs are used to uniquely identify each component file in
    #"INCL"# chunks, names are used to compose the the URLs of the component
    files in an indirect multipage DjVu file, and titles are cosmetic names
    possibly displayed when viewing a page of a document.  There are however
    many problems with this scheme, and we {\em strongly suggest}, with the
    current implementation to always make the file ID, the file name and the
    file title identical.

/** Implements DjVu multipage document directory.  There are currently two
    multipage DjVu formats supported: {\em bundled} and {\em indirect}.  In
    the first format all component files composing a given document are
    packaged (or bundled) into one file, in the second one every page and
    component is stored in a separate file and there is one more file, which
    contains the list of all others.

    The multipage document directory lists all component files composing the
    given document, helps to access every file, identify pages and maintain
    user-specified shortcuts.  Every directory record describes a file
    composing the document.  Each file is identified by a small string named
    the identifier (ID).  Each file may also contain a file name and a title.

    The #DjVmDir# class represents a multipage document directory.  Its main
    purpose is to encode and decode the document directory when writing or
    reading the #DIRM# chunk.  Normally you don't have to create this class
    yourself. It's done automatically when \Ref{DjVmDoc} class initializes
    itself. It may be useful though to be able to access records in the
    directory because some classes (like \Ref{DjVuDocument} and \Ref{DjVmDoc})
    return a pointer to #DjVmDir# in some cases. */

/** @name Format of the DIRM chunk.

    {\bf Variants} --- There are two versions of the #"DIRM"# chunk format.
    The version number is identified by the seven low bits of the first byte
    of the chunk.  Version {\bf 0} is obsolete and should never be used.  This
    section describes version {\bf 1}.  There are two major multipage DjVu
    formats supported: {\em bundled} and {\em indirect}.  The #"DIRM"# chunk
    indicates which format is used in the most significant bit of the first
    byte of the chunk.  The document is bundled when this bit is set.
    Otherwise the document is indirect.

    {\bf Unencoded data} --- The #"DIRM"# chunk is composed some unencoded
    data followed by \Ref{bzz} encoded data.  The unencoded data starts with
    the version byte and a 16 bit integer representing the number of component
    files.  All integers are encoded with the most significant byte first.
    \begin{verbatim}
          BYTE:             Flags/Version:  0x<bundled>0000011
          INT16:            Number of component files.
    \end{verbatim}
    When the document is a bundled document (i.e. the flag #bundled# is set),
    this header is followed by the offsets of each of the component files within
    the #"FORM:DJVM"#.  These offsets allow for random component file access.
    \begin{verbatim}
          INT32:            Offset of first component file.
          INT32:            Offset of second component file.
          ...
          INT32:            Offset of last component file.
    \end{verbatim}

    {\bf BZZ encoded data} --- The rest of the chunk is entirely compressed
    with the BZZ general purpose compressor.  We describe now the data fed
    into (or retrieved from) the BZZ codec (cf. \Ref{BSByteStream}.)  First
    come the sizes and the flags associated with each component file.
    \begin{verbatim}
          INT24:             Size of the first component file.
          INT24:             Size of the second component file.
          ...
          INT24:             Size of the last component file.
          BYTE:              Flag byte for the first component file.
          BYTE:              Flag byte for the second component file.
          ...
          BYTE:              Flag byte for the last component file.
    \end{verbatim}
    The flag bytes have the following format:
    \begin{verbatim}
          0b<hasname><hastitle>000000     for a file included by other files.
          0b<hasname><hastitle>000001     for a file representing a page.
          0b<hasname><hastitle>000010     for a file containing thumbnails.
    \end{verbatim}
    Flag #hasname# is set when the name of the file is different from the file
    ID.  Flag #hastitle# is set when the title of the file is different from
    the file ID.  These flags are used to avoid encoding the same string three
    times.  Then come zero terminated strings representing the IDs of each
    file.  These strings are followed by zero terminated strings representing
    the names of only those files for which the flag #hasname# is set (if
    any).  Finally come zero-terminated strings representing the titles of
    only those files for which the flag #hastitle# is set (if any).  The
    \Ref{bzz} encoding system makes sure that all these strings will be
    encoded efficiently.
    \begin{verbatim}
          ZSTR:     ID of the first component file.
          ... 
          ZSTR:     ID of the last component file.
          ZSTR:     Name of the first file for which #hasname# is set.
          ...  
          ZSTR:     Name of the last file for which #hasname# is set..
          ZSTR:     Title of the first file for which #hastitle# is set.
          ...  
          ZSTR:     Title of the last file for which #hastitle# is set..
    \end{verbatim}

    {\bf Ideas for future evolutions} ---
    Besides the version byte contained in the #"DIRM"# chunk of a multipage
    document, there is a 16 bit version number in the #"INFO"# chunk of every
    page (see \Ref{DjVuInfo.h}.)  These version numbers have different values
    and different formats.  Although one could argue that the capability to
    parse a multipage file and the capability to view the pages are different
    in nature, tracking two version numbers is often a useless complexity.
    Here is a suggested format for the beginning of the unencoded part:
    \begin{verbatim}
          BYTE:             Flags:  0x<bundled>0000011
          INT24:            Number of component files (extended to 32 bits)
          INT16:            DjVu version number (cf "DjVuInfo.h")
    \end{verbatim}
    The concept of IDs, names and titles did not provide all the expected
    benefits.  A simpler and more effective scheme would consist of only
    providing a unique ID for each component file.  The URLs of the component
    file of indirect document could be constructed using a single template
    stored in the #"DIRM"# chunk.  This arrangement would give much more freedom 
    for placing the component files on a web server. Here are a few examples
    of templates:
    \begin{verbatim}
         "${ID}"
         "${DJVUBASE}/${DJVUNAME}.dir/${ID}"
         "/cgi-bin/onthefly.pl?DOC=${DJVUNAME}.djvu&FILE=${ID}"
    \end{verbatim}
    Finally the file titles would be advantageously replaced by an optional
    chunk #"NAVM"# following the DIRM chunk and describing how the user can
    navigate the document.  This chunk would define aliases for accessing the
    pages (such as ``Chapter 1'' and ``Part 2'').  It could also define how
    these aliases can be presented in a menu representing the structure of the
    document.  The PDF specification could be a good source of ideas.
