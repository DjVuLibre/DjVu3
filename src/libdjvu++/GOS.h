    Files #"GOS.h"# and #"GOS.cpp"# implement operating system 
    dependent functions with a unified interface.  All these functions
    are implemented as static member of class \Ref{GOS}. 
    Functions are provided for testing the presence of a file or a directory
    (\Ref{GOS::is_file}, \Ref{GOS::is_dir}), for manipulating file and directory names
    (\Ref{GOS::dirname}, \Ref{GOS::basename}, \Ref{GOS::expand_name},
    for obtaining and changing the current directory (\Ref{GOS::cwd}),
    for converting between file names and urls (\Ref{GOS::filename_to_url},
    \Ref{GOS::url_to_filename}), and for counting time (\Ref{GOS::ticks},
    \Ref{GOS::sleep}).
