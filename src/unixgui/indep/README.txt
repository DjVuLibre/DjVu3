This is a top-level directory for code, which I consider more-or-less
independent of the DjVu project. They may use some tools from libdjvu++,
but these tools are nothing more than GString, GMap, etc, which may be
found in any STL

Subdirectories:

 - QT		QT widgets (portable to Windows)
 - QX		QT things, which require X11
 - except	Exception classes
 - utils	Different graphics-less utilities
